We update a table by pressing the right click button on the context menu.
The context menu opening is explained in the adding table part in this help section.
Then we can add the products selected by the client which means that the table is occupied at the moment.
We can also see all the products that are bought and in the end clear the table with the  clear button which opens up the table for other clients.
